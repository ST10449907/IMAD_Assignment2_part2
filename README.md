Purpose of the application:
-	A Tamagotchi application is a clone of a popular 1990s virtual pet toy. The main purpose of this application is to mimic the popular application which was created in the 1990s. The application simulates the experience of owning not only a virtual pet but a real pet as well. The main goal is to ensure the pets’ well-being. Users are responsible for feeding, playing, and cleaning the pet to keep it happy, healthy and clean. The user is challenged to keep the virtual pet from dying, which is mostly caused by neglect. This simulation is created to mimic the experience of owning a real pet.
Design Considerations:
-	The design of the Tamagotchi Virtual pet Application – My Baby Huskey, revolves around creating a user-friendly interface that capitalizes on the use of warm colors to create a happy and eccentric mood for the user and also simulates the real-life experience of owning a pet(A pet Huskey in this case). There are several key considerations that were considered during the design process of this application:
The Tamagotchi Virtual pet application contains the following main features:
•	A welcome page: Gives the user a brief introduction to the app and its purpose, which creates a positive mood and environment for the application.
•	Home page: The home page is the central hub for navigation. It contains buttons which enable the user to access different parts of the application. The user can access the bathroom, kitchen, and playground for their virtual pet to use.
•	Bathroom page: Enables the user to clean their virtual pet. This helps maintain the pet’s hygiene and health.
•	Kitchen page: This enables the user to feed their virtual pet. This stops the pet from dying of hunger.
•	Play page: this enables the user to play with their virtual pet. This is the cure for boredom from the pet and maintains the pet’s happiness.
•	Status Bar: The status bar enables the user to track the progress and health of the virtual pet. 
1.	User Interface: I tried to keep a consistency in the in many design elements such as colors fonts, layout and constraints to create a wonderful user experience across the screens of many android applications.
-	I also used many interactive elements such as buttons and icons to enhance the user engagement and the quality of the experience. Users can interact/use these elements to perform engaging actions such as cleaning, feeding, and playing with the virtual pet. 
-	The interactive elements are easy to identify and its easy to know the purpose they serve on the application. They have clear labels on them which can enable users of all ages to use the app and are carefully tested which ensures that the application works perfectly.
2.	Navigation: The application has clear and intuitive navigation from the home page to other sections within the app. It allows for easy access to different environments and features such as feeding, cleaning, and playing with your virtual pet Huskey.
3.	Feedback and rewards: Visual feedback is used throughout this whole application. If an action is done the user is given feedback on the progress of the Huskey. You can know if the Huskey is happy or sad/Full or hungry/dirty or clean through the feedback feature. I used a text view to output the feedback/status of the virtual pet.

My status bar works perfectly. it updates itself when an action is performed. like if the virtual pet is fed, the hunger status will go down or if the virtual pet is cleaned, the cleanliness staus will go up.
